# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
`I am very confident in my understanding and usage of the each method.`
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
`I did not struggle at all.`
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
` I'd like to know more about the syntax for printing out variables. In Java, you would type System.out.println("The number is " + num + "!"); to print a string followed by the value of a variable. In Java it's quite different.`
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
